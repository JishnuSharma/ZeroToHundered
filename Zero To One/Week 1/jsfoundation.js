/*

High level code -> Compilers / Interpreters -> 0 & 1 -> Inside ram

C++ -> Compiled language 
( The compiler converts the whole code in chunk )

JavaScript -> Interpreted Language
( The interpreter goes line by line and hence doesnt require a compilation step )

-> In case of compiled languages, if there is an error in the 
code they would not compile but in interpreted ones, if there is
 an error in the code later on then in that case they would run 
 uptil the point partially where the error is encountered

Javascript is loosely typed language 
- Causes run time errors

SINGLE THREADED NATURE OF LANGAUGES
-------------------------------------
In CPP you can forward the tasks to different threads to do it
at the same time, but in JS you cannot do it, it works on single thread.
IT CAN BE MADE TO USE CORES AT PARALLEL USING SOMETHING CALLED 

: CLUSTERING MODEL :
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-scale-node-js-applications-with-clustering

Since Node.js uses a single thread to execute your JavaScript code, all the requests to the application have to be handled by that thread running on a single CPU.

--> cluster module, which creates multiple copies of the same application on the same machine and has them running at the same time.
It also comes with a load balancer that evenly distributes the load among the processes using the round-robin algorithm. If a 
single instance crashes, users can be served by the remaining processes that are still running. The applicationâ€™s performance 
significantly improves because the load is shared among multiple processes evenly, preventing a single instance from being 
overwhelmed.

Callback hell is a situation in JS where multiple nested callback functions make your code look like its been through blender on the highest setting. 

--> Happens mostly when dealing with asynchronous operations. 
--> When one operation depends on the results of another or previous one
